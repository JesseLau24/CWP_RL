This is just for fun.

I am testing out whether Reinforcement Learning could be trained on edge devices like Raspberry Pi or not.

And if so, to what extent can the model be trained.

Again, this is just for fun!

I am currently using uConsole with CM4 core from ClockWorkPi.

A great device, but I guess I'll be getting a Pilet 5 from SoulsCircuit when that is out and tested. 

I would love to support them in their crowdfunding but I am broke now so I guess 200 dollars can be a great amount of money for me now.

That is just sad and I think I am going to stop here.
