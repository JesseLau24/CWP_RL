Don't try this at home.
This is a project for combining LSTM for return prediction and MVO for portfolio allocation.

LSTM is currently overfitting, so I assume it would be nice to extract the most relevent features for price action first, instead of training with all indicators and price data. Hopefully this would reduce the noise.

I'll see what the results would be and that's all I can say for now.
