This project is just for fun. I'll test out if RL training is possible on an edge device like Raspberry Pi CM4 device (uConsole from ClockWorkPi).

At the same time, I am going to combine MVO and Random Forest and etc for creating a portfolio that balances the risk and return.

I'll see what the results would be and that's all I can say for now.
